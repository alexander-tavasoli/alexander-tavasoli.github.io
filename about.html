                <h1> Net Neutrality is the Open Internet</h1>
                <p>For decades now, we have enjoyed open access to all data on the internet.
                This is because of Net Neutrality or the belief that all data, regardless of its
                source, is equal. Think of the internet, at least right now, like a giant pipeline where
                all content is given equal opportunity and no particular service or website
                can receive priority. However, things are changing as lobbyists and the chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai,
              threaten to repeal many of the formalized regulations protecting Net Neutrality.</p></div>
              <div class="slide"> <h1> Net Neutrality is Necessary</h1>
                <p>Without Net Neutrality, the internet would never be the same. For example, as of right now, people
                  pay for internet speed, basically how fast an Internet Service Provider (ISP) will send the data you are accessing to your computer.
                In a world without Net Neutrality, we could see data "plans" similar to those of cell phones. Considering that each latenight binge of Stranger Things
                is probably enough cellular data for a month, this would mean drastically higher prices for consumers. Moreover, even if ISPs decide
                not to exploit consumers this way, they can throttle, slow down, certain services they don't like to the point of not functioning.
              </p> </div>
              <div class="slide"><h1> Net Neutrality is the Enemy of ISPs </h1>
              <p> ISPs such as Verizon and Comcast stand to gain the most from the
                  end of Net Neutrality as they are, coincidentally, also the companies
                  that provide the bulk of America's television as well as Internet access.
                  Because the internet has taken so much of the potential marketshare for cable,
                  you don't have to be an economist to realize why they want control over the way we
                  browse. This is also obvious from the intense lobbying ISPs have committed and from the fact that
                  Ajit Pai, the current Chairman of the FCC which is a department established to regulate ISPs, used to be an exectuvie for an ISP himself. Not only
                  is this a blatant example of the intense corruption in many parts of regulatory government, it shows just how much ISPs care about this issue.</p></div>
